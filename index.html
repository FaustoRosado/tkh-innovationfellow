                <br>
                <p>After graduating from NYCDA 14-week Software Engineering Intensive bootcamp in February 2019, this writer thought he was going to get a job in the burgeoning, hot field of web development, only to find that was not the case. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I was born and raised in the south Bronx, attended public and middle school in the south Bronx, attended high school at the prestigous Brooklyn Technical High school, only to drop out and attain a GED in 1997, attend college on/off partially for a number of years afterward, yet never complete. My life is replete with fits and starts. My longest job has been 10 years and my shortest has been 2-3 months. My best learning moments have been mostly outside the classroom. Nothwithstanding NYCDA bootcamp, I am mostly self-taught and actively seek out new opportunities for learning and work. For the last year I have been working as an independent contractor performing IT & smart home product installations. I have taken an interest in learning electronics and HVAC before COVID-19 led to unemployment again.    </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In between bouts of unemployment, I have always made it my purpose to learn a new skill and apply that new skill. During 2012, I burnished my community outreach and communication skills after working with FEMA temporarily which led to 5 year job with Bronxworks Homeless Outreach Team. In 2018, I enrolled at NYCDA to learn web development. And now during this time of uncertainty and unemployment, I would like to jump back on the horse and give web development/programming another chance.

                <br>
                <p>After I stopped working late March...</p>
                <br>
                <p>Reach out to NYCDA graduates from 2019 cohort, relearn basic javascript, ruby-on-rails, learn new technologies like reactJS, while doing PluralSight, Lynda courses, and re-doing projects from NYCDA in reactJS or VueJs. Enroll in any coding/ web development community anywhere in the NYC if afforded the opportunity and if I'm approved for unemployment benefits (currently pending). Also, I am enrolled in various student subscriptions like Pluralsight, AWS student, Microsoft Azure student, courses and books I have access to. Finally, I would like to take up the 30 projects in vanilla javascript challenge, post those projects to LinkedIn, get testimonials and enroll in meetups again.  </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Enroll with TKH Innovation Fellow...</p>
                <br>
                <p>Instead of returning to gig work immediately, take advantage of the timing of the fellowship, enroll, get accepted and plan my life around attending. I would continue to work independently after exhausting any unemployment benefit I may be entitled to. Do a deep dive in javascript books and courses, do all the things in plan A, while preparing a portfolio of new projects. Total immersion in web development during the interim and continue right through the fellowship program.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Why not...?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everything about this program is timely. One, it is a year long fellowship, broken down in quarters and meets during the evenings. This set up recognizes that candidates may still need to work and raise families. Personally, this will minimize the sacrifice of having to go without working for an entire year when the program is in operation. Second, the program includes technologies like reactJS & node. I learned the hard way. Only learning limited vanilla javascript and rails, though rewarding and challenging in itself, with absolutely ZERO job support will not get me a job. And third, most importantly <em>THE KNOWLEDGE HOUSE HAS JOB SUPPORT!</em> This is so important for junior developers. This field will only get more competitive as more junior developers enter the job market. The Knowledge House is a leader in targeting my population to be successful and has cultivated the relationships with the companies. Fourth, this program is designed so that students have access to instructors, TAs, and other staff for not only technical assistance but financial assistance during the fellowship. For me, <em>ALL</em> extremely compelling reasons.  </p>
